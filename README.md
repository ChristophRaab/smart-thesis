About
=====

This template is a re-implementation of the "classicthesis" template by André
Miede. However, it uses the "memoir" class as a basis, eliminating most
of the external packages required by "classicthesis" and thus (hopefully)
achieving a higher compatibility with other LaTeX packages. Large parts of
the code have been adapted (ransacked) from André Miedes code.

You can find more information about "classicthesis" at CTAN:
